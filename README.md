# JavaScript_Codes
Some code I found when I started studying JavaScript, around 2015. All of these projects were developed using Processing software.

1 Small Circle - White rectangle centered on the screen. Gray circle that updates its position with each new play, across the entire screen.
1.2 Small Circle - White rectangle centered on the screen. Gray circle that updates its position every frame, only within the central white rectangle.
1.3 Small Circle - White rectangle centered on the screen. Gray circle that updates its position according to the mouse, only within the central white rectangle.

2 Large Circle - Random central square with a size that is a multiple of 50. Circle that fills the entire rectangle and has a random color each time the game is played.
2.2 Large Circle - Random central square with a size that is a multiple of 50. Progressively smaller centered circles down to a diameter of 10 pixels, with a random color.

3 Grid - Random central square with a size that is a multiple of 50. 10x10 grid.
3.2 Grid - Random central square with a size that is a multiple of 50. 10x10 grid that occupies the entire square, even if random. Paint the square of the grid that the mouse is over.

4 Cats - A rectangle representing a white cat named Felpudo appears randomly on the screen.
4.2 Cats - Four rectangles in random positions, representing cats:
              The first: Called Fluffy, white.
              The second: Called Sylvester, black.
              The third: Called Tom, gray.
              The fourth: Called Garfield, orange.
4.3 Cats - If the mouse is pressed on a cat, show on the console which cat was pressed, whether it meowed, and make it run across the screen with each click.

5 Balls - Three circles with random sizes, colors, and positions appear each time you play.
5.2 Balls - Three balls of random size and color appear each time the game is played, and move to different positions within the same frame when the play button is pressed.
5.3 Balls - Three balls of random size and color that move to different positions with each new play, or update the clicked ball to generate a new one.
5.4 Balls - Three balls of random size and color that move to different positions with each new play, or refresh the clicked ball to generate a new one. Each time a ball is clicked, it adds one point to the Score.
